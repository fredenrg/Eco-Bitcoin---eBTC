# Eco-Bitcoin---eBTC
Eco Bitcoin is an exploration into algorithmic virtual mining using NFTs as Proof Of Participation (POP) on the Stellar Network (Blockchain).

Virtual Miners use what we call POP (Proof Of Participation) to mine eBTC. 
Each Virtual Miner has a set speed, which is its power ratio. Virtual Miners are available on Litemint.com from Tuesday 09 April 2024 and will be released in batches. Our website (ebtc.fredenergy.org) will have a list of available VMiners.

Ownership of a Virtual Miner NFT is the owners POP, with eBTC rewards based on the Virtual Miner Type, Speed and Total Daily Emissions.

The power ratio is used to calculate the mined rewards of eBTC per hour<br>
FX100 - 1x speed
FX250 - 2.5 x speed
GFX500 - 3.6 x speed
GFX750 - 6 x speed
GFX808 - 7.8 x speed

Where;<br>
•	RewardsPerDaytype is the number of rewards generated per day for a VirtualMinerType

•	VMSpeedtype and VMNumberOftype are the speed and number of miners of a specific VirtualMinerType

•	The denominator is the sum of the products of the speed and number of all miners, representing total mining power

•	TotalDailyEmission is the total number of rewards available for mining each day

eBTC Emissions
There is a maximum supply of 21,000,000 eBTC with an annual quartering of eBTC available for the subsequent years. eBTC not virtually mined for the preceding year will be added to the calculations and a new 10-year emission schedule created.

Year	&nbsp;eBTC<br>
1		&nbsp;&nbsp;5,563,288<br>
2		&nbsp;&nbsp;4,172,466<br>
3		&nbsp;&nbsp;3,129,350<br>
4		&nbsp;&nbsp;2,347,012<br>
5		&nbsp;&nbsp;1,760,259<br>
6		&nbsp;&nbsp;1,320,194<br>
7		&nbsp;&nbsp;990,146<br>
8		&nbsp;&nbsp;742,609<br>
9		&nbsp;&nbsp;556,957<br>
10		&nbsp;&nbsp;417,718<br>

Note: Only virtually mined, and eBTC added to liquidity pools from Virtual Miner sales will be available on the markets (SDEX). This provides the scarcity factor inherent in Bitcoin.


Mined eBTC is paid hourly and weekly as follows;
50% of mined eBTC are paid hourly, the remaining 50% are accumulated and paid weekly as a claimable balance with a random claimable date between 9-12 months. The claimable date feature is used to provide a steady distribution flow.
